# Documentation website

What are my options for building a documentation website?

## GitHub repository

A GitHub repository supports Markdown files and generates a Table of Contents
automatically based on the Markdown structure.

## GitHub Pages

A GitHub repository supports a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
website. Any static website can be hosted on a GitHub Pages website but it has
built-in support for [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

## Docsy

[Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/) is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/),
created specifically for technical documentation websites. Docy is part of the
[OSPO Landscape](https://landscape.todogroup.org/) project.

## Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/)-based static site generator for documentation
websites.
